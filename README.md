# PS_MITgcm
Postprocessing on MITgcm results

## MATLAB SECTION (deprecated) 
Currently it is used for extract slides from output files generated by the Diagnostics package
**Code location:**
`./code/`
**Cases location:**
`./cases/`

## PYTHON SECTION
Used for reading files from direct outputs, diagnostics, and extracted binary file.
**Directory name**: `./py_process/`
**Directory structure**:
1. Individual code:  `./py_process/ppmode/` 
2. Module: `./py_process/code/`
3. Cases: `./py_process/cases/`



### Features
1. Instantaneous fields 
   - [x] Reading Diagnostics files (using MITgcm's `MITgcmutils.rdmds()`)
   - [ ] Reorganizing diagnostics file and store them based on the location of vertical layers
   - [x] Plotting instantaneous fields (U, V, W, SSH, T, rel. vorticity, Lap(lap(SSH)), etc.)
   - [x] Output instantaneous into movie files 
   - [x] Storing fields in tensor (for `PyTorch`)

2. Spectral analysis
   - [x] Wave-number/frequency spectra on any horizontal fields
   - [x] Rotary spectra given 2-D time series of U and V
   - [x] Fourier filters on given frequency window
   - [ ] Fourier filters on given spatial resolution window
