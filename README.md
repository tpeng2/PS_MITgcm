# PS_MITgcm
Postprocessing on MITgcm results

## MATLAB SECTION (deprecated) 
Currently it is used for extract slides from output files generated by the Diagnostics package
**Code location:**
`./code/`
**Cases location:**
`./cases/`

## PYTHON SECTION
Used for reading files from direct outputs, diagnostics, and extracted binary file.
**Directory name**: `./py_process/`
**Directory structure**:
1. Individual code:  `./py_process/ppmode/` 
2. Module: `./py_process/code/`
3. Cases: `./py_process/cases/`



### Features
1. Instantaneous fields 
   - [x] Reading Diagnostics files (using MITgcm's `MITgcmutils.rdmds()`)
   - [x] Reorganizing diagnostics file and store them based on the location of vertical layers (meta data object: `$HOME/postproc/results/saved_obj/`, tensors used for PyTorch: `$HOME/postproc/results/layered_ts/` 
   - [x] Plotting instantaneous fields (U, V, W, SSH, T, rel. vorticity, Lap(lap(SSH)), etc., saved in `$HOME/postproc/img/` )
   - [x] Output instantaneous into movie files 
   - [x] Storing fields in tensor (for `PyTorch`)

2. Spectral analysis
   - [x] Wave-number/frequency spectra on any horizontal fields
   - [x] Rotary spectra given 2-D time series of U and V
   - [x] Fourier filters on given frequency window
   - [ ] Fourier filters on given spatial resolution window

#### Example 1 

Code for reorganize Diagnostics MDS files:
** Executable shell script **
`./py_process/sh_script/run_load_diagnostics.sh`

In this file, edit the desired parameters and case information:

For example,
`
dx=500
dy=500
Lx=480000
Ly=960000
ind_z=1,2,3,4,5,20,60
fhead='Diag_snaps_UV'
path_scratch=$HOME/scratch/MITgcm_cases/
path_results=$HOME/postproc/results/
groupname=''
casename="rel_uvar_9"
start_ind=700000
end_ind=734421

tape_days=7
Fs=8
dt_model=75
z_target=1`

| Parameter  | input | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| dx  | 500  | zonal resolution |
| dy  | 500  | meridional resolution |
| Lx  | 480000  | zonal dimension |
| Ly  | 960000  | zonal dimension |
| ind_z  | 1,2,3,4,5,20,60  | index of vertical layers stored in Diagnostics file (see data.diagnostics) |
| fhead  | 'Diag_snaps_UV'  | (string with quotation marks) File head of specific diagnostics file, can be changed later for the desired field |
| path_scratch  | $HOME/scratch/MITgcm_cases/  | where raw case is stored |
| path_results  | $HOME/postproc/results/  | where extracted results will be stored |
| groupname  | ''  | (string with quotation marks) group name (parent directory of cases) |
| casename  | 'rel_uvar_9'  | (string with quotation marks) case name (directory name) |
| start_ind  | 700000  | the lower limit for searching file index |
| end_ind  | 734421  | the upper limit for searching file index |
| tape_days  | 7  | how many days one saved file contains (1.2 GB for one field for 7 days with dx=dy=500m) |
| Fs  | 8  | sampling rate of diagnostics file (Fs=8 <==> getting samples every 14400s)|
| dt_model  | 75  | timestep size in MITgcm model |
| z_target  | 0,1,4,5  | (dummy currently) desired vertical layer to store tensors |
